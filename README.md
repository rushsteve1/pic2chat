# Pic2Chat Prototype

This is an extremely rough prototype of Pic2Chat that I whipped up.
None of the code here should in any circumstance be used in the final project.
I just wanted to do this to get a feel of what the project would be.

Serve the files using whatever webserver you want (`python3 -m http.server`
works well) and start the websocket server with Deno (command is in
`server.ts`).
